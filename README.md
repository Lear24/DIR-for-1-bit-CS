Distributed Reconstruction via with Invex Relaxation for Compressive Sensing Signals

This repository provides the code for all numerical experiments and empirical experiments in the paper "**Distributed Reconstruction from Compressive Measurements: Nonconvexity and Heterogeneity**".

Due to license restrictions, the raw dataset corresponding to the application in â€‹**Section 5** of the paper is not provided. However, the experimental code, including data preprocessing, is available.
